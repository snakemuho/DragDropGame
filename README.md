### 2. **Item dragging**
- The item can be picked up and dropped around the level.
- The item either falls down, snaps to the closest furniture or to the floor.
- The `Item` script serves as the central script that determines what each component of the item should do.
- `Drag component` defines the item's drag behavior, and tracks if the item is being dragged.
- `Gravity component` makes the item fall or stop falling, and tracks the item's velocity.
- `Collision tracker` tracks if the item is inside the furniture's or floor's colliders, and events that should happen when the item enters these colliders.
- `Snap component` makes the item either snap to the closest furniture, or to the floor.
- `Audio component` defines the audio that should play when the item is picked up.

### 3. **Background**
- Where the item will snap is determined by colliders placed around the level.
- There is a single collider for the floor that has a `Floor` tag
- For each furniture object there is a collider with a `Furniture` tag
  - The item snaps to the closest point on the `x` axis of the collider, and to the lowest border of the collider on `y` axis
